                There are many forms of situational awareness, but the place you should start is education. Knowing who and what is around you can be important when you are in public just in case anything happens. All forms of situational awareness include three essential steps: Recognizing - seeing someone or something that doesn't seem natural and could be dangerous, Assessing - look around and think of what you could do if something happened all of a sudden, Responding - do whatever you see fit that is mostly legal that will increase your chances of making it out of this dangerous situation alive and intact. Situational Awareness helps prevent errors and deviations and there are lots of research sources that confirm this. There are also plenty of examples of how not having situational awareness causes human error.

            <p>Situational awareness requires you to be constantly looking around you to see what is happening in the environment, but donâ€™t focus on every minute detail, focus on the elements that will help you reach a certain point. Situational awareness is definitely important when you are a driver because there are so many things on the road that can cause so many dangerous situations. Paying attention to the road when driving is the number one priority no matter the situation. If you need to take care of something, pull over when it is safe to do so. There are so many unpredictable things that can happen, like animals running across the road, impatient drivers speeding past you, unseen potholes, and a variety of things when going up a hill. Situational awareness is key for survival in most if not all situations and most people would agree when that is said.
