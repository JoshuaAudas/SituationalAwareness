                There are many forms of situational awareness, but the place you should start is education. Knowing who and what is around you can be important when you are in public just in case anything happens. All forms of situational awareness include three essential steps: Recognizing - seeing someone or something that doesn't seem natural and could be dangerous, Assessing - look around and think of what you could do if something happened all of a sudden, Responding - do whatever you see fit that is mostly legal that will increase your chances of making it out of this dangerous situation alive and intact.
